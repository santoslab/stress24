# stress24 - Student Schedule and Guidelines


## Preliminaries

### Install and Confirm Installation with Examples

Make sure that have installed Sireum -- the download and installation instructions can be found [here](stress24-logika-tool-installation.md) 

## Clone the STRESS 2024 repository

Clone the following git repository for the STRESS 2024 material...
```
git clone https://github.com/santoslab/stress24
```

## Opening the Logika examples in the Sireum IVE

**In a terminal window, move to the top level of the git repository that
you cloned above.**, e.g., 
```
cd stress24
```

**MacOS/Linux**

To prepare the following SIREUM IVE projects for use in the SIREUM IVE
(creates IntelliJ metadata for an IntelliJ project)
```
export SIREUM_HOME=~/Applications/Sireum
"${SIREUM_HOME}/bin/sireum" proyek ive stress24-examples-ive
"${SIREUM_HOME}/bin/sireum" proyek ive hamr-examples/isolette/hamr/slang
```

Launch the SIREUM IVE from your file browser or from the command line..
```
open "${SIREUM_HOME}/bin/mac/idea/IVE.app" 
```
..or for linux
```
"${SIREUM_HOME}/bin/linux/idea/bin/IVE.sh"
```

Using the IDE File/Open open, open the `stress24-examples-ive` folder.

**Windows**

To prepare the following SIREUM IVE projects for use in the SIREUM IVE
(creates IntelliJ metadata for an IntelliJ project)
```
set SIREUM_HOME=%USERPROFILE%\Applications\Sireum
"%SIREUM_HOME%\bin\sireum.bat" proyek ive stress24-examples-ive
"%SIREUM_HOME%\bin\sireum.bat" proyek ive hamr-examples\isolette\hamr\slang
```

Launch the SIREUM IVE from your file browser or from the command line..
```
"%SIREUM_HOME%\bin\win\idea\bin\IVE.exe"
```

Using the IDE File/Open open, open the `stress24-examples-ive` folder.


## Morning Session #1 (M1): 1.5 hours

This session will introduce you to the Slang programming language (safety-critical subset of Scala) and the Logika program verifier for Slang.  You will learn basic aspects of the Sireum Integrated Verification Environment (IVE) interface and aspects of the Slang programming language -- building up to some simple exercises using conditional expressions and method calls.

**Overview of Slang/Logika** 

This lecture module is a slide-only overview of Slang and Logika, with
a short summary of the contents of this tutorial.

**Logika Basics**  

This lecture module (a) introduces you the Slang language features (b)
illustrates the basic aspects of interacting with Logika verification.

 * In the `stress24-examples-ive` examples and exercises are found in
   the `Morning-01` folder

In comments in many of the files, simple exercises are suggested for you on
your own.

## Morning Session #2 (M2): 1.5 hour

This module introduces you to Logika verification of while loops

 * In the `stress24-examples-ive` examples and exercises are found in
   the `Morning-02` folder

## Lunch (2 hour break)

## Afternoon Session #1 (A1) 1.5 hours

This module covers advanced Logika techniques related to integrating
SMT-based verification with automated theorem proving techniques.

 * In the `stress24-examples-ive` examples and exercises are found in
   the `Afternoon-01` folder

## Afternoon Session #2 (A2) 1.5 hour

This module illustrates how Logika is integrated with the HAMR
model-driven development environment.

 * Example code is found in the 
   hamr-examples\isolette\hamr\slang

Manage Regulator Mode exercise - see this
[description](slides/Images/HAMR-Manage-Regulator-Mode-exercise.png)

![Exercise Description](slides/Images/HAMR-Manage-Regulator-Mode-exercise.png)

These lectures/activities illustrate the use of Slang and Logika in the context of an industrial strength model-driven development framework called HAMR.   With HAMR, 
* system architectures are defined in AADL or SysMLv2, 
* contracts are added to architecture descriptions to specify desired functional behavior,
* deployable project skeletons are auto-generated from HAMR, along with code-level contracts for application components,
* developers code application logic, and use Logika verification (and automated testing) to demonstrate that the application code conforms to contracts

In this activity, you will learn the basic aspects of the workflow steps above.  *The emphasis is on understanding how Logika verifies that application code conforms to contracts*.

These activities use the KSU SAnToS Isolette example -- a simple
infant incubator with curated artifacts designed to illustrate
end-to-end formal-methods-integrated model-based development.
