Define a variable
Write an assertion

Click on light bulb and lightning bolt annotations in margin
Change assert claims or initial assignments to show how Logika
 detects assertion violations

-----------------
var my_x = 50   // a variable identifier
val my_y = 30   // a value identifier

assert(my_x == 50)
assert(my_y > 20)
-----------------

Illustrate how we can update a var but not a val
Illustrate our previous assertion expression for my_x now causes a failure
 because we updated the value for my_x

Illustrate the At(..) notation

-----------------
my_x = my_x + 1
// my_y = my_y + 1  // re-assignment to val identifier not allowed

// assert(my_x == 50)  // Logika detects assertion violation
assert(my_x > 50)
-----------------

=====
// Suggested Exercises
//  - define your own waypoint named myWayPoint
//  - make an assertion expression that sums all three fields of the waypoint
//     and compares to some desired upper bound that you wish to enforce
=====


Define a WayPoint data type, explain the syntax and the empty section for methods

-----------------
// Define datatype (immutable) for a 3-dimensional waypoint (similar to ML datatype)
@datatype class WayPoint(x: Z, y: Z, z: Z)  // x,y,z are members of the class of Slang type Z (unbounded integers)
{}  // no methods defined for this type

// Construct a way point
val wayPoint01 = WayPoint(30,30,50)

// Make an assertion on a WayPoint field
assert(wayPoint01.x < my_x)
-----------------

=====
// Suggested Exercises
//  - define your own waypoint named myWayPoint
//  - make an assertion expression that sums all three fields of the waypoint
//     and compares to some desired upper bound that you wish to enforce
=====

Add predicate to capture the condition of being "in Zone"
Explain the concept of @strictpure (allows us to use the function in a Logika specification)

Add an assert saying that wayPoint01 is inZone,
then show way happens if we change wayPoint01 so that it is not in the zone.

------------------
@strictpure def inZone(wayPoint: WayPoint): B = // body of most strict pure functions is an expression
      ((-100 <= wayPoint.x & wayPoint.x <= 100)
    &  (-100 <= wayPoint.y & wayPoint.y <= 100)
    &  (-100 <= wayPoint.z & wayPoint.z <= 100))

assert(inZone(wayPoint01))
------------------

=====
// Suggested exercises
//  - create a waypoint that does not satisfy the inZone predicate and illustrate
//    the failure with a failing assertion.  Then add a second assertion in which
//    you assert that the waypoint is not inZone (this assertion should hold)
=====



Add method/function to operate on waypoints
Note the syntax for datatype field "update" and
  discuss that we are not destructively updating the object, but instead creating
  a new version of it
Add a call to the method
Click on annotations in method body and note that these do no reference
 variables outside of the method

-----------------
def moveForward(wayPoint: WayPoint): WayPoint = {
  val x_new = wayPoint.x + 10
  val wayPoint_new = wayPoint(x = x_new)
  assert(wayPoint != wayPoint_new) // sanity check
  return wayPoint_new
}

val wayPoint01moved = moveForward(wayPoint01)
------------------

=====
// Suggested exercises
//  - uncomment the print state and run the Slang script to show the effect of
//    the move operation
//  - assert that the y fields of wayPoint01 and wayPoint01moved are equal (==)
//    Note: this assertion should fail, because Logika checks method
//     compositionally and relies on method contract information to determine
//     the facts known to method callers (we'll explain this in the next part)
//  - click on the light bulb at the failing assertion to see the facts
//    that Logika knows at that point.
=====


Add contract requiring that the moveForward operations always requires an inZone
wayPoint

------------------

def moveForward(wayPoint: WayPoint): WayPoint = {
  Contract(
    // require that we are given a waypoint "in the zone"
    Requires(inZone(wayPoint))
  )
  val x_new = wayPoint.x + 10  // change "10" to e.g., "12" to illustrate Logika finding error
  val wayPoint_new = wayPoint(x = x_new)
  return wayPoint_new
}

---------------------

Show that callers have to satisfy the pre-condition

---------------------
moveForward(wayPoint01)
moveForward(WayPoint(50,90,50))
---------------------

Try to strengthen the contract

---------------------

Add the following ensures clause and show that the
method implementation does not satisfy it

---------------------
  Ensures(inZone(Res[WayPoint]))
---------------------

Add a different post-condition
Show that the body satisfies the post-condition
Make an error in the body to show that the post-condition is violated
(e.g., subtract 10 instead of add 10)
Click on the lightning bolt to show the sequent representing the post-condition

---------------------
    Ensures(Res[WayPoint].x > wayPoint.x,
      Res[WayPoint].y == wayPoint.y,
      Res[WayPoint].z == wayPoint.z)
---------------------

Reason about what the callers know about the method results

---------------------

assert(wayPoint01moved.y == wayPoint01.y)
// assert(inZone(wayPoint01moved))                 // fails
// assert(wayPoint01moved.x == wayPoint01.x + 10)  // fails

=====
// Suggested exercises
//  Make an alternate version of the post-condition as follows, and show that
//  the two failing assertions above now hold (explain why)
//   Ensures(Res[WayPoint].x == wayPoint.x + 10
//      Res[WayPoint].y == wayPoint.y,
//      Res[WayPoint].z == wayPoint.z)
=====

#################  Part 6 - @datatype Invariant ###################

Add an invariant to the WayPoint @datatype

-----
@datatype class WayPoint(x: Z, y: Z, z: Z)  // x,y,z are members of the class of Slang type Z (unbounded integers)
 { // datatype invariant is checked for every constructor call
   //  and assumed for every use
   @spec def WayPoint_Inv = Invariant(
      x >= -1000 &
      y >= -1000 &
      z >= -1000
  )
 }
-----

Such invariants must always hold for every value of the datatype.
Thus, whenever you create a datatype, Logika will check that the
invariant holds.

----
// illustrating datatype invariant enforcement
val wayPoint03 = WayPoint(-984,-20,92)  // change "-984" to "-1084" to illustrate Logika finding error (pre-condition violation)
----

illustrate the effect of the invariant when using a datatype value

----
def arbitraryWayPoint_y(wp: WayPoint): Z = {
  Contract(
    Ensures(Res[Z] > -1100)
  )
  // the parameter wp is an arbitrary WayPoint, we don't know anything about it,
  // other than the fact that it must satisfy the invariant
  val local_x = wp.x
  assert(local_x >= -1500) // holds, because invariant says that x coordinate of WayPoint must always be >= -1000
  return wp.y
}
----

// Suggested exercises
//  - define a datatype Point with x and y coordinates.
//    Include an invariant that states that x always lies between -50 and 50 (inclusive)
//      and y is less than x
//  - create some code that shows Logika enforcing the invariant, i.e.,
//     valid Points can be created, but invalid Points are flagged as errors
